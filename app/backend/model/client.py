"""
The one boundary every local-model call passes through: a whole chat in,
raw text out. Callers interpret that text; this module does not.

MODEL is the only place the concrete model is named, so a swap is a
one-line change here (see docs/05-decisions.md). TEMPERATURE is likewise
set once here for every call — not per call site.

think=False is unconditional, not a qwen-specific branch. Some
models expose a separate thinking channel; left on, it has taken 3+
minutes and returned empty `content` because the trace consumed the
response (docs/05-decisions.md #21). Models without that channel
ignore the flag.

PROVIDER is Ollama unless CHAT_PROVIDER=openrouter is set: the hosted
model is for the public demo only (docs/05-decisions.md #70), so it is
never chosen by default.
