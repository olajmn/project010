"""
Checks the docs/ vault's structural integrity: the expected files
exist and nothing stray sits alongside them, every [[wikilink]] and
docs/<name>.md-style reference resolves to a file that actually
exists, and each numbered doc's own "# NN — Title" heading matches its
filename.

docs/archive/ is optional and unmaintained: any file may sit there, and
nothing outside it may link or point into it, so the folder can be
deleted at any time without breaking a reference.

Deterministic only - no semantic judgment about where content belongs
(see COLLABORATION.md), no automatic rewriting. Companion to
docs_lint.py, which checks prose style rather than structure/references.

Lives at the project root, not under current/ or app/, because docs/
itself is now a shared resource spanning both projects (see README.md)
- one checker, one docs/ vault to be true against, rather than a
separate copy per project drifting out of sync with the other.

Run from the project root (stdlib only, no venv required):
    python3 -m tools.docs_check

Exit code 0 if nothing found, 1 if any problem is reported.
