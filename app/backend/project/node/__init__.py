"""Project node — the one unit of the family tree (parent/child).

Not the visual map. Above panes/: canvas draws nodes; chat talks about
nodes; this package defines what one node is (`node.py`) and the
tree-as-text walk (`tree_as_text.py`). Node ids are made in
backend/identity/, with every other id. Map UI stays in panes/canvas/.
