"""
Accounts (account#N) — data/accounts.json.

Project current + events live in project_persistence.py. Shared roots
(DATA_DIR, now_utc, …) live in paths.py.

An account is a plain {id, text, created_at} record — no history.
Projects may reference one via optional account_id. Archiving mutates
the account record in place; detaching projects is a higher-level decision
(project_account.archive_account()). Sticky project mint high-water is
`account_n_hi` (see project_persistence._next_account_n()).

Every record also carries a stub user_id (DEFAULT_USER_ID) — the
operator of this app, not the multi-account filter.

Permanent delete leaves a tombstone ({id, user_id, deleted, deleted_at})
so an account id is never reused: closed projects keep their
account_id, and a reused id would silently hand them to a new account.
Tombstones count toward the next id and are invisible to every other
function here.
