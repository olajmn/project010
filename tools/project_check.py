"""
Cheap, deterministic repository orientation - meant to run at the start
of a session, so it doesn't have to trust its own memory or
docs/04-current-state.md's prose at face value. Reports observable
facts: git status, files newer than docs/04-current-state.md, app/'s
actual backend/ tree, whether the core modules still import,
code-level hygiene (Ruff, mypy, stale backend/ path mentions, modules
with no inbound import), whether each project's log replays to its
tree, and this same tools/'s docs_check.py/
docs_lint.py findings.

Interprets nothing about content or correctness - every finding is
left for a human/Claude to judge. See ../COLLABORATION.md for how a
session is expected to use this output. Wraps docs_check.py and
docs_lint.py (this same directory - one shared tools/ for the whole
project, not a per-project copy), Ruff, and mypy as sub-checks rather
than duplicating their logic.

Run from the project root, but against app/'s own venv (this is the
only project this script's backend/import checks target):
    app/.venv/bin/python3 -m tools.project_check

Exit code 0 if docs_check.py, docs_lint.py, Ruff, mypy, the import
smoke test, and the replay check all pass; 1 if any of them found something. Every other
section is pure information and never affects the exit code.
