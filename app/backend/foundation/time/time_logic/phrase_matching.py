Finds known time phrases in free text and turns them into concrete
values (hours, dates, offsets), using the pattern tables in the
sibling time_data/ package. Matches and interprets only - deciding
how a match is used or described is duration_resolution.py's job.

extract_duration_phrase() below is the only function meant to be
called from outside this package - it returns the raw phrase text,
