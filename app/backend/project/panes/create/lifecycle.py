"""
A project's lifecycle: mint one, abandon one, restore or erase.

Identity and current state stay in resolver.py - this module only
writes. Mint is create_project() — a name and an empty canvas, no
engine. Renaming the label is rename.py. Cancelling never does.
Vision is accepted here as an optional link at birth, but
linking/unlinking later stays on project_account.set_project_user()
until Vision's own shape is decided.

    Mark a project as cancelled (abandoned) - a distinct terminal status
    from `completed`, not a UI-level relabeling of it and not a third
    planning decision. Preserves `plan` and `account_id` from the
    latest record exactly as they were, so the project's own data/history
    is never lost, only marked as no longer being pursued (still
    visible in full in the project's timeline, same as any other project).

    Returns the newly saved record, or None if the change is
    rejected - never partially applied:
    - `project_id` doesn't resolve to any project.
    - the project is already completed - a finished project doesn't also
      become abandoned; one terminal status wins, and completion,
      already decided, isn't overwritten by a later Cancel click.

    Requesting cancellation on an already-cancelled project is a genuine
    no-op - returns `latest` unchanged rather than appending an
    identical record (same idiom as set_project_user()).
