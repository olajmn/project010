"""
You send a message, you get a reply back.

Cases:
- A slash-command (`/add`, `/select`, …): chat/commands/ runs it; same save
  path as an ordinary chat message (map-writing commands update the tree first).
- Anything else: the model answers, given what
  model/brief/conversation.py puts together.

The message and reply are saved, so the chat is still there after a
reload.
