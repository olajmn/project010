Puts together what the model is sent when you press Send, in order:

1. The system text: the fixed slots from talk_prompt.py, then the
   project background — its summary rows and last changes
   (project/status/; the panel above the chat shows the summary and a
   per-day count instead), every name in its structure, and the part
   or the day of changes you have selected.
2. The earlier chat, as real back-and-forth messages.
3. Your new message.

No model call, nothing saved.
