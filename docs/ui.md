# UI

How the app's screen is laid out, how it should look, and where its code lives.

## 1. The columns

```text
┌──────────┬─────────────────┬──────────┐
│ sidebar  │     canvas      │   chat   │
└──────────┴─────────────────┴──────────┘
```

| Column | Job | Not its job |
|---|---|---|
| **Sidebar** | Accounts and their projects; create a project; Settings | The map; column widths |
| **Canvas** | The open project's nodes | Files on disk; old plan fields |
| **Chat** | The conversation, optionally about one node or one day of changes | The map itself |

The canvas is not a file browser: a future files view belongs in the
sidebar, not the middle column.

The three columns float as **one block** on the page, with round outer
corners and one line where two columns meet. The chat can be hidden with
the bubble in the block's top-right corner (filled while open, hollow
while hidden); hidden, it leaves a thin double line at the edge, which
drags it back out.

## 2. The canvas

```text
[#6]                     ← id (a header, not a node)
  └── [css setup]        ← project title (a header, not a node)
        │
        ○ node           ← top-level node (label + ⋯)
        │    · child
        │
        (+)
```

- **One vertical spine** under the title; children hang under their
  parent. Lines meet box edges, never cross labels.
- **Id and title** are headers in the same box style, but not nodes: no
  ⋯, add, or remove.
- **Each node** is its label and ⋯. Add here, Remove, and Move up / down live in ⋯; the
  `+` under the spine stays visible.
- **Brightness shows the hierarchy.** Top-level nodes are always bright;
  deeper ones are muted, except the level just above the deepest one
  shown, which is bright too and moves with − / +. Line view brightens
  the same nodes' bars. The selected node adds an accent underline and
  border on top of that.
- **One frame, no tabs.** − / + shows fewer or more levels. Scrolling
  (wheel or two fingers) and dragging pan, vertically; pinch or
  Ctrl/Cmd+scroll zooms; double-click resets to an
  overview. Below ~20% zoom the view switches to **Line** (each bar is a
  node), above ~26% back to **Text**; the toolbar can pin either.
- **An empty project** opens at natural size with a short hint, not a
  zoomed-out empty frame.
- **Controls around the map** are stamped into the strips above and
  below it — signs and words, no boxes; hover only brightens them, and
  symbol-only ones show a short label. On top: × ↑ − + and Text | Line
  (not highlighted: the view switches by itself with zoom). Below:
  **+ Add** opens one menu for the ways to add many nodes (Paste
  structure, Add folder, Insert saved tree…); Copy as ASCII and Archive
  are icons.
- **A faint dot grid** lies behind the map and moves with pan and zoom;
  it dims as the map zooms out, and instead of packing tighter, every
  other dot fades out, stepping to a wider spacing.

Not planned for now: free placement of nodes, panning outside the frame,
card-style nodes.

## 3. The look

- **Hierarchy first.** Sort what is loud, quiet, and hidden before any
  styling. If two things look equally loud, the hierarchy failed.

  | Loud | Quiet | Hidden until needed |
  |---|---|---|
  | Project title, selected node | `id`, child nodes, lines | Add / Remove (in ⋯) |

- **Complexity is budgeted.** The canvas may be rich — the tree, menus,
  and lines are the product's own UI. Shell, sidebar, and chat stay calm.
  Add a signal only when it earns a place; prefer removing one.
- **Two base planes**, dark (the default) and light (Settings →
  General), both neutral (no warm tint). All three columns share one background.
- **Shape over lines:** soft fills and rounded corners instead of
  outlines — nodes, buttons, fields, menus. Menus sit on a slightly
  lighter surface instead of casting a shadow.
- **One accent** (system blue) means selected, active, or focused;
  Remove is red. Nothing else is coloured.
- **System font** (SF Pro on Apple devices); IBM Plex Mono for code and
  ASCII.
- **Frosted glass was tried and parked** (`TODO.md` § Ideas): over a
  calm backdrop it added little, and text blurring under the map's top
  strip made the controls there restless. The backdrop's soft gradients
  stay.

## 4. Where the code lives

- **Mirror rule:** `app/ui/src/<area>/` ↔ `app/ui/css/<area>/`, same
  names on both sides — behavior in `src/`, look in `css/`. A new
  surface gets or extends a pair, not a dump into `style.css`.
- **Areas:** `shell/` (column widths, collapse, busy state — glue, not a
  parent), `panes/create/` (sidebar and accounts), `panes/canvas/`,
  `panes/chat/`, `settings/`, `demo/` (login page and Log out, public
  demo only).
- **Tokens:** shared look lives once in `css/tokens.css`. If it should
  look the same everywhere, change a token; don't add a colour in an
  area file.

## 5. Done when

- Changing a few tokens retints the whole UI.
- Naming an area lets you open its `src/` and `css/` folders at once.
- A stranger tells primary from secondary text at a glance.
- The map stays rich; everything around it stays calm.
