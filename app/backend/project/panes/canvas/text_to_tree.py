"""
Parse a pasted outline or ASCII tree into a forest of Node-shaped
labels — no model call. For pasting a structure built elsewhere (e.g.
another LLM's own answer) back into the map's nodes.

Tolerant of several styles at once, since a paste's origin is
unknown: markdown bullets ("-", "*", "•"), numbered lists ("1.",
"2)"), this app's own box-drawing export (copyAsText.ts's "└── "/
"├── "/"│"), or plain lines with no marker at all. Depth is read from
each line's raw indentation column, not from matching a single fixed
grammar, so mixed styles and tab/space indentation both work.

    """
    Returns a forest of {"label": str, "children": [...]} nodes,
    oldest/top first. Blank lines and pure connector "air" lines
    (this app's own export pads between siblings with a lone "│") are
    skipped, not read as empty nodes.

    If parsing produces exactly one root with children (a title line
    followed by a nested list — a common shape for another LLM's
    answer), and `unwrap` is true (the default), that root is unwrapped
    once and its children are returned instead of it, so the title
    itself doesn't become a spurious top-level node. Only once, not
    repeated: this app's own export nests two labels above real content
    (an id line, then the project name), and unwrapping both would be
    right for reimporting that export - but a generic pasted outline
    can just as easily have a genuinely meaningful two-level chain
    (e.g. "New Hospital" -> "Current State" -> real content), which
    repeated unwrapping would silently discard.

    Whether that single outer line is a throwaway title or content the
    user actually wants kept is not something this parser can know -
    it only sees position (is this line alone at the top?), never
    meaning. `unwrap=False` returns the raw parse, title line included,
    for a caller that wants to show the user both and let them choose
    (see progression_zoom.import_map_outline()'s own `unwrap`
    parameter and server.py's preview route) rather than this parser
    silently guessing for them.
