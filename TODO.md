# TODO

Not a duplicate of `docs/04-current-state.md` - that file is a short
snapshot of what's true now, including known limits. This file only
tracks which of those are
actually being worked on (**Active**), a numbered catalog of
everything still open (**Queue**), and a **Parallel paths** table of
dual/redundant code — so scope and active pairs stay visible at a
glance.

Done / removed Stage-3 and old-plan items are **not** kept here;
their history lives in `docs/05-decisions.md` and git history. An
item moves from Queue to Active only when
deliberately chosen as next.

## Active

The UI/UX pass, starting with real content to design against.

56. **UI/UX pass: how the screen looks** (Step) — presentation only,
    not new features: hierarchy (loud / quiet / hidden), spacing, type,
    and the look of the canvas, chat, Current state, and sidebar,
    judged against the demo projects (`app/demo_seed/`). Principles and layout:
    `docs/ui.md`. The main pass is done ([[05-decisions]] #68), Settings
    included; left: 57 (tree on the dot grid). Frosted glass is parked
    (§ Ideas). Items that may fold in when they come up: 53 (`/select`
    hint), 54 (undo), 45 (copy one branch), 38 (changed nodes on the
    map).

## Queue

Each item: kind (**Bug** / **Step** / **Question**) and impact tier
(**1** wrong today → **4** large new domain; **Untiered** = design
only). Numbers are stable ids, not rank.

### Tier 1

21. **Week/day calendar baseline** (Step, parked) — Time can still
    compute `week_windows()` / `day_windows()`, but nothing in the
    product calls them since project calendar fill was removed. Only
    relevant if time returns to the map (year face, ambient timeline).
    Related to 17, 27.

### Tier 2

12. **Decomposition / zoom** (Step) — map is user-steered
    (`plan.progression`); + / × / Paste / Add folder under a selected
    node write it. Naming a node in chat without the full path is
    Queue 53. Model-proposed children were removed ([[05-decisions]]
    #60, #63); if they return, as an explicit `/suggest` that proposes
    in the chat and leaves adding to the user.
30. **No written API reference** (Step) — short overview of each
    `/api/...` address.
44. **Repo cleanup pass** (Step) — what is left of a file review on
    2026-09-26; the docs part was done 2026-09-27 (#57). Numbers are
    kept from the original list.

    6. **`requests_from_browser.py` routing** — POST goes through the
       `_POST_ROUTES` table, but `do_GET()` is still one `if/elif` on
       `self.path`. Not urgent. Related to 30.
    7. **Test gaps** — no tests for `requests_from_browser.py` or any
       UI TypeScript; `edit_map.py` is covered only for the saved text
       of remove, import, and move (`test_edit_map.py`).
45. **Copy one branch as ASCII** (Step, after cleanup) — Copy as ASCII
    (`panes/canvas/copyAsText.ts`) always copies the whole tree. Add
    either a **Copy branch** item in the node ⋯ menu, or let Copy as
    ASCII copy only the selected node's subtree when one is selected.
    Not a chat `/` command: a dump in the thread is noise, and the
    thread goes back to the model — same reason Print map was dropped
    ([[05-decisions]] #48).
49. **A proper way to check node ids** (Step, shape open) — node ids
    are identity ([[05-decisions]] #52) and never reused (`node_id_hi`),
    but nothing lets you see or verify them. Candidates:
    1. **Inspect:** partly done — the chat's `/id` shows the selected node's
       id or switches the map to ids ([[05-decisions]] #55). Still
       open: a flat overview of every node (Settings → Nodes: project,
       id, label, parent, depth), like Directory shows Local # +
       Global ID.
    2. **Verify:** a check (e.g. in `tools/project_check.py` or a test)
       that walks `data/projects/*/current.json` and reports duplicate
       ids in one tree, ids above `node_id_hi`, and `focus_step_id` on
       events pointing at an id that never existed.
    Rules live in `app/backend/project/node/README.md`.
50. **Node ids → globally unique random ids** (Step, before data is
    shared outside this app, not during mockup) — `p<N>` ids are
    sequential and unique per project only: they collide when data from
    several projects, devices, or another app is merged, need one
    counter (`node_id_hi`), and leak count/order. Target: **UUIDv7** or
    **ULID** (128 bit: no practical collisions, time-sortable, no
    counter). Not short random digits: 7 digits (10^7) reach ~50 %
    collision odds at ~3,700 ids.
    1. Identity stays separate from content (#52): the id is random and
       stable; a hash of structure can serve as a fingerprint (e.g. to
       show a saved tree is unchanged), never as the id.
    2. Display a short prefix (6–8 chars, like git); addressing by
       prefix must be unique within the project.
    3. Single change point is `_id_minter()` (`edit_map.py`); old `p`
       ids referenced by `focus_step_id` in `events.jsonl` need a
       transition (keep them, or map old → new). `node_id_hi` becomes
       unnecessary.
    4. Open question: which side mints node identity if another app
       shares the data.
51. **Saved trees follow-ups** (Step, when needed) — built 2026-09-27
    ([[05-decisions]] #54). Open:
    1. Rename a saved tree (name is the node label at save time).
    2. A library view outside the picker (list, rename, delete), e.g.
       under Settings or the account.
    3. Unassigned projects (`account_id` null) share one library.
    4. `source` ({project_id, step_id}) is provenance only; a
       cross-project identity belongs with Queue 50.

53. **`/select` gives no hint when it fails** (Step) — matching stays
    exact on purpose (full path from the top, exact name): a command
    that guesses could select the wrong node unnoticed. What is
    missing is a useful reply instead of "No node at path": where a
    unique name actually sits (`"1. Planning" is under BIRTHDAY PARTY
    - try /select BIRTHDAY PARTY / 1. Planning`), or the closest name
    for a typo. Clicking a node stays the main way to select. Rules in
    `panes/chat/commands/node_path.py`. Split out of 12.
54. **Undo for map edits (Ctrl+Z)** (Step) — removing a node now asks
    first when it has children (41, closed), but nothing can be
    undone. Likely shape: keep the last 10–20 versions of the tree
    before each map edit (the events tape holds only short texts, not
    the tree); Undo puts the previous version back as a new saved
    change. To decide: which edits count (add, remove, paste, folder,
    insert tree, rename?), whether undo survives a reload, redo,
    Ctrl+Z only while the map has focus (text fields keep their own
    undo), and a visible Undo after a remove. With undo in place the
    remove confirmation may go. Also open from 41: removing a node but
    keeping its children (moved up a level).

58. **Login** (Step, branch `auth`, **paused** by [[05-decisions]] #70)
    — one user signs in and manages several accounts; the app looks as
    it does today. Steps and open questions: `docs/auth-plan.md`; why:
    [[05-decisions]] #69.
60. **Demo limits** (Question) — whether the public demo's caps fit
    real use: 50 sessions at once; chat 10 a minute per session, 20 per
    IP, 500 a day (`app/backend/api/demo/settings.py`, [[demo]]).
61. **Zero data retention for the demo's chat** (Question) — whether to
    require ZDR at OpenRouter; the test calls went to SiliconFlow
    ([[05-decisions]] #70).

62. **"Talk" left in code names** (Step, not crucial) — docs and
    comments call it "the chat" since 2026-10-14; the old name remains
    in identifiers: `TALK_PROVIDER` (also set in `app/fly.toml`, so a
    rename needs a deploy), `model/brief/talk_prompt.py`, `_save_talk()`
    in `panes/chat/reply.py`, and the demo limits `talk_per_session` /
    `talk_per_ip` / `talk_per_day` (`TALK_PER_*`, `DEMO_TALK_PER_DAY`
    in `api/demo/settings.py`). Rename together, with the tests, when
    there is a reason to touch them. `05-decisions.md` keeps "Talk" as
    history; "Talk about …" in the UI is ordinary English and stays.

### Tier 4

9. **A second capability** (Step) — the app can only do Project today.
10. **Memory domain** (Step) — not built.
11. **Knowledge / RAG** (Step) — not built.
13. **Acting** (Step) — no external action.
14. **Continuity / proactivity** (Step) — no scheduler / background
    behavior. Related to 17.
25. **2D box-diagram import** (Step) — paste today is indentation /
    outline only (`text_to_tree.py`); true 2D box diagrams need a
    different path (likely schema-constrained model read).

### Untiered

17. **Practices have no shape** (Question) — recurring open-ended
    commitments ("10 push-ups a day") fit no current axis.
27. **What counts as a session / visit** (Question) — if the agent
    should understand time-with-the-user, build on `created_at` in
    project history / Logs, not server starts.
33. **The chat only sees the map's labels** (Question) — model gets labels
    + focus path, not file contents / notes behind a node. [[05-decisions]]
    #33.
37. **Rename Status code to Current state** (Step, not crucial) —
    UI says "Current state"; folders/`status` wire/`build_status` still
    say Status. Optional later (avoid confusing with disk `current.json`).
    Related to 34.
38. **Click a Changes day → map + chat focus** (Step, parked) — the
    chat part is built ([[05-decisions]] #62): a day in Current state
    selects that day's changes for the chat, framed like node About. Still
    open: highlight the nodes touched that day on the map, and richer
    import text ("Imported 95 nodes under X" counts every node but does
    not say which; added and removed steps already say what and where).
    Related to 34.
39. **Chat commands that force a SoT pass** (Step, keep in mind) —
    e.g. a chat "full check" that deliberately re-reads `current` (+
    events) — the product twin of Cursor `/full-check`, for the *user
    project* not this repo. Current state panel is mainly for the human;
    the model already gets a slice via `status_text`, but explicit
    commands are optional later. Lives under `panes/chat/commands/`
    when built. Related to model brief (#42 in decisions; was Active 40).
57. **Line the map up with the dot grid** (Step, later) — the dot grid
    behind the map (`app/ui/css/panes/canvas/dotGrid.css`) and the tree
    are not aligned: indent and row height (`panes/canvas/spacing.ts`,
    `map.css`) are set in `rem`, independently of the dot spacing. To
    align, pick one base unit (e.g. 8–9px) and make the indent step, the
    row pitch, and the dot spacing whole multiples of it, and offset the
    grid by the viewport padding so it starts where the tree does. Easy
    first half: only the vertical spines on dot columns (the indent is
    already fixed). Holds at every zoom: zoomed out, the grid
    only drops dots, and every dot left is on the 1× grid. Layout change,
    not CSS only.
63. **How much context the chat gets** (Question) — the goal is that
    the chat can use the whole project as context: the map and the full
    history of changes. Today each message sends a fixed slice instead:
    every label, the last 10 changes, the changes on a selected day,
    and the last 20 turns ([[04-current-state]] § 4). Sending everything
    every time does not scale: slower replies, weaker answers from a
    small model as the prompt grows, and a cost per token on the demo.
    Candidate shapes, not decided:
    1. **Summary** — older history condensed into a short text that is
       always sent.
    2. **Lookup** — the model fetches what a question needs from the
       history, instead of getting it all up front.
    3. **Richer events** — each saved change says more, so the slice
       already sent carries more (38).
    Related: 33 (labels only, not what is behind a node), 38, and the
    open question in [[04-current-state]] § 6.

## Ideas (not decided)

Not planned and not built — kept so they are not lost. Moving one into
the Queue is a deliberate choice.

- **Node types and fields** — a node could carry a type and structured
  fields, not only a label and children (cf. Tana; `docs/01-research.md`).
- **More than one parent** — letting a node sit in several places would
  turn the tree into a graph; the node model would stay, the relation
  rule would change (`docs/00-project-brief.md` § 2).
- **Export / share a structure** — a branch or project as a document or
  file others can open (Queue 45 copies one branch as ASCII).
- **Sync across devices** with end-to-end encryption, the local copy
  staying the real one (`docs/03-architecture.md` § 5).
- **Other front ends on the same data** — the node data is portable, so
  a different interface could read it.
- **Frosted glass as a material** (tried 2026-09-29, parked) — a Settings
  switch (Solid | Glass) that made the floating block, the map's top
  strip and menus translucent with a blur (block alpha 0.66, blur 48px,
  saturate 160%). Over the calm Graphite backdrop it was barely visible,
  and the tree blurring under the top strip competed with its controls.
  Worth trying again only with a livelier backdrop behind the block and
  a solid top strip; the sketch `glass-sketch.html` (git-excluded, repo
  root) still has the knobs.

## Parallel paths

Dual code is allowed; **unnamed** dual code is not. Update this table
when a path is deleted, rewired, or reclassified.

| # | Pair | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Week grain vs session grain | Time Faculty only | `week_windows()` / `day_windows()`; nothing in the product calls them — Queue 21 |
| P2 | Even-slice `step_plan` vs dates on the step | Time Faculty only | `frozen_duration.step_plan`; nothing in the product calls it |
| P4 | Tree as text: indented labels vs ASCII tree | Deliberate, one per side | `project/node/tree_as_text.py` (`tree_lines()`, for the model) vs `ui/src/panes/canvas/copyAsText.ts` (clipboard); same walk, the model side cannot run in the browser and the clipboard should not need a server round trip |
| P5 | Event kind → word: Logs titles vs day tally | Deliberate, different grain | `project/timeline.py` `GROUPS` ("Map") vs `project/status/build_status.py` `_TALLY_WORDS` ("added", "removed", "imported"); a new event type goes in both, or it shows as Other / other |
| P7 | Popover dismiss (close on outside click / Esc) | Five copies, all working | The node ⋯ menu (`panes/canvas/drawNodes.ts`), the confirmation (`confirmPopover.ts`), the saved-tree picker (`savedTrees/insertTree.ts`), + Add (`addMenu.ts`, copied from the picker) and the chat / menu (`panes/chat/commands/menu.ts`) each close themselves with their own code. One shared helper next to `placePopover.ts` would let a change (e.g. close on scroll) happen in one place |
| P8 | Chat model call: local Ollama vs hosted OpenRouter | Deliberate, one per environment | `backend/model/client.py` `send_chat()` picks one by `TALK_PROVIDER`: `ollama.chat()` (default) or `openrouter.chat()` (public demo, [[05-decisions]] #70). Same model, temperature, and no-reasoning setting on both; a change to one (e.g. a new option) must be made in both |
| P9 | Default theme: page script vs `theme.ts` | Deliberate, the script prevents a light flash | Every page in `app/ui/` (`index.html`, `login.html`, `settings/*.html`) sets `data-theme` in a small inline script before the CSS loads; `src/user/theme.ts` `getTheme()` decides the same default for the code. Dark unless the user chose light: a change to the default goes in both |
