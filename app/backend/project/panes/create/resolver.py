"""
Read and interpret project history.

This module does not store anything - it reads via project_persistence
and answers, by project_id:

- What is the full event tape for this project?
- What is the current SoT record for this project?
- What is the current record for every project that exists?

Whether a project counts as "active" or "completed", and how projects
get grouped or sorted for display, is board-building logic, not project
identity.

project_id itself is minted in project_persistence.py (_next_project_id()),
not here - moving it here would create a circular import between the two
modules. See docs/05-decisions.md for why identity is a minted id, not
the project's display name.
