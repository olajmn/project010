"""
A project's timeline: every saved change, in order, as plain events —
created, chat, node added, renamed, archived, ...

Every change is already saved as one timestamped line in
data/projects/{id}/events.jsonl (storage/project_persistence.py). This file only reads
those lines back as events; it writes nothing. Used by Settings → Logs
(api/activity_log.py) and the project timeline address
(/api/projects/<id>/timeline). See docs/04-current-state.md § 2.
