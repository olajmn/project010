    """
    Add, move, or remove a project's account link after mint.
    `account_id=None` removes the project from whichever account it
    currently has.

    Unlike the chat's reply() (which takes an already-resolved `latest`
    record), this resolves `project_id` itself, since the route calling
    it has no other reason to look the record up first.

    Returns the newly saved record, or None if the change is
    rejected - never partially applied, and never raises for an
    ordinary bad input:
    - `project_id` doesn't resolve to any project.
    - `account_id` is given but no such account exists (a stale/tampered
      value - the real UI always offers ids from `load_accounts()`, so
      this is a defensive check, not the normal path).

    Requesting the account the project is already linked to (or already
    has none, for `account_id=None`) is a genuine no-op - returns
    `latest` unchanged rather than appending an identical record. A
    cancelled project (see cancel_project()) is also a no-op here — never
    a save_plan() call that could silently revive it.

    Preserves `plan` and `completed` from the latest record exactly as
    they were -
    this changes which account the project belongs to, nothing about the
    map itself.

    Archive an account (accounts_persistence.archive_account()) and detach it
    from every currently-active project that references it - an archived
    account is no longer an active seat, so an active project
    shouldn't keep showing a current tie to it. Account and project have
    independent lifecycles: this never changes a project's plan or
    completed/cancelled status - only which account (if
    any) it currently points to.

    Completed/cancelled projects keep their account_id unchanged - already
    a closed, historical record, not a claim that the account is still
    active, so there's nothing to detach.

    Detaching reuses set_project_user(project_id, None) per project rather
    than writing a second way to change a project's account link, so it
    inherits that function's safety checks. Like set_project_user(),
    this appends a new record per affected project (project_id carried
    forward) - no existing record is ever mutated or removed.

    unchanged, on a repeat call), or None if account_id doesn't exist.
