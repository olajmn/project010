"""
A duration has no fixed meaning as "long" or "short" on its own - only
relative to another duration it's measured against (see
docs/03-architecture.md). "15 minutes" is short next to a full day,
long next to a single minute.

This module answers only "is this span long or short compared to that
span" - pure magnitude. It says nothing about what an activity NEEDS
(a 45-minute run and a 45-minute stretch aren't "the same 45 minutes") -
that's a separate, unbuilt question.
