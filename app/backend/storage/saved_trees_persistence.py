"""
Saved trees — data/saved_trees.json.

A per-account library of structures (see project/saved_trees/). Plain
records, no history: {id, name, account_id, saved_at, source, tree}.

Tree ids (`t1`, `t2`, …) are never reused: the file keeps an `id_hi`
high-water mark, so a deleted tree's id stays retired. (Node ids are a
different kind: random, from project/node/identity.py.)
