"""
One project node: the recursive Step shape at every depth of the
family tree (parent/child). The atom the rest of the system builds from.

Depth is data, not type — where a step sits in the tree, not what
class it is (project/node/README.md).

Pure shape — no model call, no persistence. Stored inside
plan.progression; leftover plan.steps is not read here. Canvas/chat
are faces of nodes; they do not own the shape.
