# project010

project010 is a working application that explores how information can be
organized in a persistent, visual structure and made available through a
conversational interface.

Can an explicit structure of information and its relationships make it
easier for an AI to work with context over time, instead of having to
reconstruct it from separate conversations?

In practice: you build a project as a tree of parts (a building, a
training plan, a folder on disk). The tree and its history are saved, and
on every message the chat reads them — the whole structure, the part you
select, and recent changes — so it answers from the project instead of
starting from scratch.

**Live demo:** https://demo-one.fly.dev — ask me for the password. Each
visitor gets their own copy of two example projects. How the demo works:
`docs/demo.md`.

**Built with:** Python (FastAPI; checked with pytest, Ruff, and mypy),
TypeScript (no framework, no bundler), plain JSON files for storage, and
a language model through Ollama locally or OpenRouter in the demo.

## Where to start reading

1. `docs/00-project-brief.md` — what the project is
2. `docs/03-architecture.md` — how it is built
3. `docs/05-decisions.md` — what was decided, and why

## What is where

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `app/` | The application: Python backend, TypeScript UI, local data |
| `docs/` | The project's documentation (Markdown; `[[name]]` links follow Obsidian's style) |
| `tools/` | Checks for the repository and the docs |
| `global-standards/` | General, project-independent style and collaboration guides |
| `TODO.md` | What is being worked on, what is open, and ideas |
| `CONVENTIONS.md` | This project's technical conventions |
| `COLLABORATION.md` | How to work in this project: which doc answers what, which checks to run |

## Docs

| Doc | Answers |
|---|---|
| `docs/00-project-brief.md` | What the project is |
| `docs/01-research.md` | What to look for outside it |
| `docs/02-product.md` | The foundation and the app |
| `docs/03-architecture.md` | How it is built |
| `docs/04-current-state.md` | What is true now |
| `docs/05-decisions.md` | What was decided, and why |
| `docs/ui.md` | The screen, and where UI code lives |
| `docs/demo.md` | The public demo: how it works and how to deploy it |

## Run it

Needs Python 3.14, Node.js, and [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with the
model `qwen3.5:9b` (`ollama pull qwen3.5:9b`). Once, from `app/`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ui && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

Then, from `app/`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m server
```

and open http://localhost:8000/. Tests, checks, and the UI build:
`docs/04-current-state.md` § 1, or `/full-check` in Claude Code.
